As an example consider the C declaration int anArrayName Syntax : datatype anArrayname[sizeofArray]; In the given example the array can contain 10 elements of any value available to the int type. In C, the array element indices are 0-9 inclusive in this case. For example, the expressions anArrayName[0] and anArrayName[9] are the first and last elements respectively.
For example, an array of 10 32-bit integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as 10 words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, ... 2036, so that the element with index i has the address 2000 + 4 Ã— i.
