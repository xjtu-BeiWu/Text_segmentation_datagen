The algorithm is as follows:
Input: An array P with n elements and an empty stack N
Output: An array S of n elements such that P[i] is the largest integer k such that k <= i + 1 and P[y] <= P[i] for j = i - k + 1,.....,i
Algorithm:
1. Initialize an array P which contains the daily prices of the stocks
       2. Initialize an array S which will store the span of the stock
       3. for i = 0 to i = n - 1
               3.1 Initialize k to zero
               3.2 Done with a false condition
               3.3 while not (Stack N is empty or done with processing)
                     3.3.1 if ( P[i] >= P[N.top())] then
                               Pop a value from stack N
                     3.3.2 else
                               Done with true condition
               3.4 if Stack N is empty
                        3.4.1 Initialize h to -1
               3.5 else
                        3.5.1 Initialize stack top to h
               3.6 Put the value of h - i in S[i]
               3.7 Push the value of i in N 
       4. Return array S
