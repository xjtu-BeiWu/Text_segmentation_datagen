Many useful array slicing operations (such as selecting a sub-array, swapping indices, or reversing the direction of the indices) can be performed very efficiently by manipulating the dope vector. Static arrays have a size that is fixed when they are created and consequently do not allow elements to be inserted or removed. An array is stored so that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.
