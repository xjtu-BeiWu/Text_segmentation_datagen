I was asked to implement an AVL tree , and I did it- now it works for all stress-tests I could think about. now I see we were advised to implement it, s.t it inherits from binary search tree that inherits from a binary tree. I want to it right- I'll be glad to get an advice on which invariants (fields that have to appear) should appear in each of them ( the binary tree, the search and the AVL).
