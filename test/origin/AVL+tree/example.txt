AVL tree with balance factors (green)
To be balanced, every node in the tree must, either,

    have no children, (be a "leaf" node)
    Have two children.

    Or, if it has only one child, that child must be a leaf.

    In the chart you post, 9, 54 & 76 violate the last rule.

Root: 23
(23) -> 14 & 67
(14) -> 12 & 17
(12) -> 9
(17) -> 19
(67) -> 50 & 72
(50) -> 54
(72) -> 76
